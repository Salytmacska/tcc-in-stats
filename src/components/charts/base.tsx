            <p>Welcome to the "T90 Community Cup in Stats" website. This website collects all the statistics you could ever want to know about the tournament in one place!</p>
            <p>The data, by default summarizes the entire tournament (as of 2024.08.12). Use the filters on the toolbar to view the data pertaining to a particular group, map or bracket.</p>
            <p>So let's jump in with the most encompassing stats first:</p>
            {isFilterApplied ?
                <p>There were <span className={styles['highlighted-text']}>{filteredDraftsData.mapDrafts.length}</span> sets played over the course of the tournmament, that match the selected filters.</p> :

            <h2>Drafts data</h2>
            <p>The following charts summarize the data gathered from the drafts.</p>
            <p>This chart is showing the number of times each map was picked during a draft. Note that any map not picked was banned so no separate chart for that.</p>
            <MapPickChart draftsData={filteredDraftsData} filter={filter}></MapPickChart>
            <p>Next up is civilization picks in the drafts specifically.</p>
            <CivPickChart draftsData={filteredDraftsData} filter={filter}></CivPickChart>
            <p>Finally civilization bans.</p>
            <CivBanChart draftsData={filteredDraftsData} filter={filter}></CivBanChart>
            <h2>Games data</h2>
            <p>So we know which maps were picked in the drafts. But which ones were actually played?</p>
            <MapPlayChart gamesData={filteredGamesData.filter(game => game.map != null)} filter={filter}></MapPlayChart>
            <p>The next chart shows the number of times a civilization was played. If you are curious about a specific map, or ELO range, then use the filters accessible using the filter button on the top-right.</p>
            <CivPlayChart gamesData={filteredGamesData.filter(game => game.map != null)} filter={filter}></CivPlayChart>
            <p>Which civ is the best? Below is the win rate chart. Hover each column to get the important additional context of the number of games played.</p>
            <CivWinChart gamesData={filteredGamesData.filter(game => game.map != null)} filter={filter}></CivWinChart>
            <p>How long each game was? Let's see on the next graph!</p>
            <GameTimeChart gamesData={filteredGamesData.filter(game => game.map != null)} filter={filter}></GameTimeChart>
            <p>Who is the fastest player in the tournament? We can see the eAPM over all brackets</p>
            <ApmChart gamesData={gamesData.filter(game => game.map != null)} filter={filter}></ApmChart>
